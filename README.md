# Language-translation
The Language Translator with Audio Output is a web-based application that allows users to translate text from one language to another and hear the translated text as audio output. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project leverages the MyMemory Translation API for text translation and the Web Speech API for text-to-speech functionality. The application provides an intuitive interface for users to input text, select source and target languages, translate the text, and listen to the translation in the target language.

This project is designed to be simple yet functional, making it an excellent tool for language learners, travelers, or anyone needing quick translations with audio feedback. It supports a wide range of languages and includes features like language swapping and text copying for enhanced usability.

Features

Audio Output: Convert translated text to speech in the target language using the Web Speech API.
Language Selection: Choose from a curated list of 23 languages for both source and target text.
Language Swap: Easily swap source and target languages with a single click.
Copy Functionality: Copy either the input or translated text to the clipboard.
Responsive Design: User-friendly interface that works across different screen sizes.
Error Handling: Robust handling of API errors and speech synthesis issues with user feedback.
Technologies Used

Audio Quality: Speech output quality depends on the browser's text-to-speech engine and language support.
Internet Requirement: Translation requires an active internet connection.
Troubleshooting
No Audio Output:
Ensure your device's sound is not muted.
Check browser console (F12) for errors.
Try a common language like English (en-GB) first.
Translation Fails: Verify internet connection and check API response in the console.
Speech Not Supported: Use a supported browser (Chrome recommended) if the "Speak Translation" button is disabled.
